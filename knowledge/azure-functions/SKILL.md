# Azure Functions

## Patterns

### Isolated Worker Model (.NET)

Modern .NET execution model with process isolation

### Node.js v4 Programming Model

Modern code-centric approach for TypeScript/JavaScript

### Python v2 Programming Model

Decorator-based approach for Python functions

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Blocking Async Calls

### ❌ New HttpClient Per Request

### ❌ In-Process Model for New Projects

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Issue | high | ## Use async pattern with Durable Functions |
| Issue | high | ## Use IHttpClientFactory (Recommended) |
| Issue | high | ## Always use async/await |
| Issue | medium | ## Configure maximum timeout (Consumption) |
| Issue | high | ## Use isolated worker for new projects |
| Issue | medium | ## Configure Application Insights properly |
| Issue | medium | ## Check extension bundle (most common) |
| Issue | medium | ## Add warmup trigger to initialize your code |
