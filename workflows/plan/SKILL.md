## Preamble (run first)

```bash
# Detect project state
AG_HOME="${HOME}/.Ultimate SDLC"
AG_PROJECT=".ultimate-sdlc"
AG_SKILLS="${HOME}/.claude/skills/ultimate-sdlc"

# Check if project is initialized
if [ -d "$AG_PROJECT" ]; then
  echo "PROJECT: initialized"
  # Read current state
  if [ -f "$AG_PROJECT/project-context.md" ]; then
    COUNCIL=$(grep -A1 "## Active Council" "$AG_PROJECT/project-context.md" | tail -1 | tr -d ' ')
    PHASE=$(grep -A1 "## Current Phase" "$AG_PROJECT/project-context.md" | tail -1 | tr -d ' ')
    STATUS=$(grep -A1 "## Status" "$AG_PROJECT/project-context.md" | tail -1 | tr -d ' ')
    echo "COUNCIL: $COUNCIL"
    echo "PHASE: $PHASE"  
    echo "STATUS: $STATUS"
  fi
else
  echo "PROJECT: not initialized (run /init first)"
fi

# Read global config
if [ -f "$AG_HOME/config.yaml" ]; then
  GOV_MODE=$(grep "governance_mode:" "$AG_HOME/config.yaml" | awk '{print $2}')
  PROJ_TYPE=$(grep "project_type:" "$AG_HOME/config.yaml" | awk '{print $2}')
  echo "GOVERNANCE: ${GOV_MODE:-standard}"
  echo "PROJECT_TYPE: ${PROJ_TYPE:-web-app}"
fi
```

After the preamble runs, use the detected state to verify prerequisites for this workflow.

# /plan - Project Planning Mode

---

## Lens / Skills / Model
**Lens**: `[Requirements]` | **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4
> Apply RARV cycle, session protocol per the active council rules file

## 🔴 CRITICAL RULES

1. **NO CODE WRITING** - This command creates plan file only
2. **Use Planning Council** - NOT Claude Code's native Plan subagent
3. **Socratic Gate** - Ask clarifying questions before planning
4. **Dynamic Naming** - Plan file named based on task

---

## Task

Use the `[Requirements]` lens agent with this context:

```
CONTEXT:
- User Request: [user request]
- Mode: PLANNING ONLY (no code)
- Output: docs/PLAN-{task-slug}.md (dynamic naming)

NAMING RULES:
1. Extract 2-3 key words from request
2. Lowercase, hyphen-separated
3. Max 30 characters
4. Example: "e-commerce cart" → PLAN-ecommerce-cart.md

RULES:
1. Follow council-planning.md Phase -1 (Context Check)
2. Follow council-planning.md Phase 0 (Socratic Gate)
3. Create PLAN-{slug}.md with task breakdown
4. DO NOT write any code files
5. REPORT the exact file name created
```

---

## Expected Output

| Deliverable | Location |
|-------------|----------|
| Project Plan | `docs/PLAN-{task-slug}.md` |
| Task Breakdown | Inside plan file |
| Agent Assignments | Inside plan file |
| Verification Checklist | Phase X in plan file |

---

## After Planning

Tell user:
```
[OK] Plan created: docs/PLAN-{slug}.md

Next steps:
- Review the plan
- Run `/create` to start implementation
- Or modify plan manually
```

---

## Naming Examples

| Request | Plan File |
|---------|-----------|
| `/plan e-commerce site with cart` | `docs/PLAN-ecommerce-cart.md` |
| `/plan mobile app for fitness` | `docs/PLAN-fitness-app.md` |
| `/plan add dark mode feature` | `docs/PLAN-dark-mode.md` |
| `/plan fix authentication bug` | `docs/PLAN-auth-fix.md` |
| `/plan SaaS dashboard` | `docs/PLAN-saas-dashboard.md` |

---

## Usage

```
/plan e-commerce site with cart
/plan mobile app for fitness tracking
/plan SaaS dashboard with analytics
```
